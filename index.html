                    <p>I was always interested in computers, technology and airplanes. I am the kind of guy who will
                        always
                        search to understand how things work. I like the seamless working of everything technical and
                        like
                        the automation of it.</p>

                    <h2 class="ui header">Hacker ?</h2>
                    <p>A hacker is someone who is able to take stuff, see how it works and then adapt it and use it in a
                        way that solves his problem. Every few years, hackers gadder in events where they solve problems
                        all together. I am part of hacker community's since 2016 and have become more and more involved
                        in it over the years.<br>
                        I have volunteered in those community's, have been network and system administrators in some of
                        them and will continue for years to come. I hope I can help people getting in as much as the
                        community has helped me.
