                    <p>I was always interested in computers, technology and airplanes. I am the kind of guy who will
                        always
                        search to understand how things work. I like the seamless working of everything technical and
                        like
                        the automation of it.</p>

                    <p>A hacker is someone who is able to take stuff, see how it works and then adapt it and use it in a
                        way that solves his problem. Every few years, hackers gadder in events where they solve problems
                        all together. I am part of hacker community's since 2016 and have become more and more involved
                        in it over the years.<br>
                        I have volunteered in those community's, have been network and system administrators in some of
                        them and will continue for years to come. I hope I can help people getting in as much as the
                        community has helped me.

                    <p>Because of my interest in aviation, I wanted to take one step further. So I stepped a foot in the
                        door to see what is possible inside the industry. Turns out that the knowledge from the IT
                        industry can be useful in the aviation industry, but the opposite also turned out to be
                        true.</p>

                    <p>My mother tongue is French. I also learned to speak Dutch from a very young age. When I was
                        growing up, I did all my extra-curricular activities. For English, I had to learn it by
                        listening and reading it. Back in 2010, when I started getting access to the internet, almost
                        all the content about computers was in English. I started with that. And today, I'm fluent in
                        French, Dutch and English.</p>
